# Why take this class

You should take this class if you want to see how things will go in your future CSC classes this is a opportunity to learn about something that can be very benefical to you inside your future classes. You learn alot about the history of github and computers and topic that you would normally not see in other CSC classes. Your taught how to use version controls with GITHUB and how to approach projects with different languages. 

This class offers experience with working with groups on assignments, yall know how to approach your assignments for other classes in the future and you will be better prepared to do work and know what language u will need in the future. 


I believe this class is important because for a student like me I did not know how to start my projects and I wasnt to secure with programming but alot of the assignments for example made me research into other languages that are like the famous ones and I found it really interesting because it showed me there were more programming languages out there beside C and java. This will also allow you to learn scripting and bash which getting a head start with your future classes will help. 

I believe you should be taking these classes to sprout yourself forward in the future and take a relaxing course journey through a class that I gurantee will help you in the future. I personally really wish I had something like this during my earlier years now that im a senior the class is still fun but this was very much needed and I hope it will help me students in the future.
